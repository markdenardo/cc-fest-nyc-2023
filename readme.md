What makes a project Live Coding?<br>
What makes a project Creative Coding?<br>
What can we do in other frameworks that we can also do in Scratch?<br>

Because Scratch was developed with many of the features we see today in contemporary creative coding frameworks,<br>
we can safely test and iterate Live Coding and Creative Coding techniques on Scratch,<br>
using software engineering and design theory.<br>
